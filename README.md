# movie-recommender-system
🎬 Just built a Movie Recommender System using Python!

Using content-based filtering and cosine similarity, this system suggests top 5 similar movies based on the one you love. 🚀

📌 Tools used:
Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)

🔍 Whether you're a Matrix fan or love Inception, this tool will give you the next great watch!

Excited to explore more in the world of recommendation engines.
